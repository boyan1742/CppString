# C++ String

This is a string class that is used in some of my projects in Sofia University in Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.

## Usage

Just copy-paste it in your project.
**Disclaimer**: To use the `Split` method, you need two things:

1. have the `Array.hpp` header in your project. [Link](https://github.com/boyan1742/CppArray).
2. add before the inclusion of the header the following line:

```cpp
#define USE_SPLIT
```
